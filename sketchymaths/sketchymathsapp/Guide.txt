(Small introduction found under 'Load'.  Goto Load screen, click 'Load Examples', and click Introduction)

-Double-Click or Double-Tap:
Creates new Equation

To deleted an equation, click on it and clear its equation text.
Then when you click on a different equation, or create a new one, the 'empty' one will be deleted.

-Left Click on a different Equation:
Switch focus of text inputs to different Equation

-Left Click and drag outside of an Equation:
Allows you to drag the entire screen, moving all Equations at once relative to the point grabbed.

-Middle Mouse Button:
Replaces selected text (or inserts if none is selected) with :name: of Equation clicked on (unless clicking on self) into text input.

-Pressing 'enter' while the Equation Text Editor is in focus will cycle through selecting references, if any are present.

-Scroll Wheel over an Equation:
This will increase or decrease the font size of the Equation

-Scroll Wheel outside of an Equation:
This will zoom in and out globally.  The zoom point is the mouse position.

-'F1' will open the settings menu

-type ':equation name:' to reference a different equation inside of another one
-References will be evaluated just the same as if you had entered in their result
(e.g. if you have one equation (x0)= 1+1 then type :x0:+1 into a different equation, it will display '3'.
These references will also be displayed by a line showing the path of the reference.
(from the equation referenced to the equation referencing it.)

-Equations that are successfully evaluated will be white, while equations that could not be evaluated will appear grey.

-If you type '#' anywhere in the equation text it will skip evaluation and become a comment, and the text will appear light blue.

-Since colons ':' are used to find references, you cannot have them in your equation names.
If you try they will be replaced with semi-colons.

-If you decide to manually enter in a self reference to an equation it will display (Self) to remind you that you tried to start an infinite loop.
(There is also a depth_limit, so if you make strange references that end up in a loop it should be okay, though you won't get a solution)

The two text inputs at the top of the screen edit the equation and its name.
    -Whatever equation you last clicked appears in the TextInput where you can edit it.
    -New equations automatically take over the focus of the TextInput
    -Equations appear in bold when they are in focus.

Each equation is created with a generic id 'x0' that can be changed by typing in the left text input.
    -Type ':x0:' with x0 being the name of another equation to reference that equation.
    -These references will be displayed by an arrow pointing from the equation referenced to the equation referencing it.
    -Middle clicking on another equation will automatically insert the equation's name into the text input.

Equations are updated as you type, and any equations referencing the one you are currently editing will also update.

Equations can be dragged around and rearranged on the screen.

The equations accept basic math functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using the expected symbols (+,-,*,/).
Exponents use the python notation of a double asterisk (**).
The python.math functions are also called inside of the equations, allowing for things such as sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), sqrt(x), or so on.

Constants such as 'e' or 'pi' also work.
