SketchyMaths
=============================

MindMapping for Maths.  Allows for a blackboard style approach to
math, letting you have multiple math problems on the screen, while
also evaluating each in real time.  It also allows for taking the
result of one problem and using it in another, and if you change
any dependencies all of the problems that use them will update
with the changing results.
