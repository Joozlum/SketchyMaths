=============================
SketchyMaths
=============================

MindMapping for Maths.  Allows for a blackboard style approach to
math, letting you have multiple math problems on the screen, while
also evaluating each in real time.  It also allows for taking the
result of one problem and using it in another, and if you change
any dependencies all of the problems that use them will update
with the changing results.


Features
--------
* Evaluates most mathematical equations
* Allows for multiple equations to be evaluated separately
* The result of one equation can be used in another equation.
* If one equation is changed any other equations dependant on it are also updated.
* Works similar to an excel sheet, but where you can move and change the size of 
    the cells, and arrows show where values are going.

Usage
-----

Launching the app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Check requirements.txt to see if dependencies are installed.

`Kivy` is compatible with Python 2 as well as Python 3::

    cd sketchymaths
    python main.py

Adding Custom Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can add any sort of custom function to SketchyMaths.  The examples are a simple percent conversion
(takes in percent and converts it to a decimal) and the slightly more involved logic gate
(takes in a gate name, followed by any number of arguments, then outputs True or False.  Also allows for changing
what the true or false test values are, rather than the default true=1 false=0.)

Here you can also add custom constants if there is a constant that you frequently use,
such as e or pi (these are already added by default).

Navigate to::

    cd sketchmaths/sketchymaths
    open sketchymathmethods.py in text editor
    follow instructions in file
